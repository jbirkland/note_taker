# 11 Express.js: Note Taker

## Ojective
Modify starter code to create an applicaton that can write and save notes. The app uses Express.js and saves and retrieves notes from a JSON file.
The idea is for a user to be able to use the application to organize thoughts and keep track of tasks. You can also delete notes as well.
